# SarcasmLens – Subjective Sarcasm Detection in Code-Mixed Text

## Problem Statement: 
Sarcasm and irony in Indian social-media posts often emerge through subtle cues such as exaggeration, code-mixing of Hindi and English, emotive punctuation, or cultural references. Detecting such subjectivity poses unique linguistic and contextual challenges. 
The task is to create a system that can automatically identify sarcastic expressions in code-mixed social-media text while capturing the underlying subjectivity that distinguishes sarcasm from ordinary sentiment.

## Objectives : 
1. Investigate linguistic patterns of sarcasm in multilingual and code-mixed
environments.
2. Construct an appropriate representation of text that preserves both language and
stylistic information.
3. Design and justify an approach for distinguishing literal from sarcastic statements
under noisy, informal text conditions.
4. Reflect on the rationale for data selection, model design, and evaluation strategy.
